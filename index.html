They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li></b>
                                     <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li> 
                                     <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li> 
                                     <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph..</li> <h3><p>

                                             <li>"Cicada" comes from the Latin, meaning "tree cricket." While cicadas are oftenreferred to as a kind of locust, they are not part of the locust family.</li> 
                                             <li>There are about 3,000 known species of cicada worldwide.</li> 
                                             <li>For the most part, cicadas subsist on the fluids of living trees.</li> <h3
